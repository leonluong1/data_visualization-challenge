# Pymaceuticals Inc. Analysis
This project is about examining the thousands of different mice that were tested with different cancer regimens and analyzing their results. 
We analyze their tumor sizes at different stages as well as try to draw correlations with other metrics to gain valuable insight.

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my Pandas, Matplotlib, and Stats knowledge at the same time. Starter code was provided and I added extra code to fill the report.
I also included a Word document that provided analysis for the mice and their regimens.
The file types in this repository are ipynb files, csv files, docx files and md files.
